  <h1>Sture Development</h1>
  <p>Our apps and games are not our best ideas. They are simply the ideas that we got done.</p>
  <p>We are mere lazy nerds who really wants to play Mario Kart.</p>

  <h2>Our 10 (two) apps</h2>

  <h3>Knot! Knot!</h3>

  <p>"Who's there?"</p>
  <p>"The Cambridge Tie Model!"</p>

  <h3>Frac-Tac-Toe</h3>
  <p>"Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe", "Super Tic-Tac-Toe" or for the super nerds "(Tic-Tac-Toe)<sup>2</sup>"</p>
  <p>We liked the ambiguity so much we decided to give it yet another name: "Fractional Tic-Tac-Toe". You're welcome.</p>
