  <h1>Sture Development</h1>
  <p>Our apps and games are not our best ideas. They are simply the ideas that we got done.</p>
  <p>We are mere lazy nerds who really wants to play Mario Kart.</p>

  <h2>Our 10 (two) apps</h2>
  <p>Trying to do something unique and memorable, with something that has already been done a thousand times before.</p>

  <p>"Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe", "Super Tic-Tac-Toe" or for the super nerds "(Tic-Tac-Toe)<sup>2</sup>". We liked the ambiguity so much we decided to give it yet another name: "Fractional Tic-Tac-Toe". You're welcome.</p>

  <h2>Our attempts at making games</h2>
  <p>We have participated in a few instances of Ludum Dare. With varied levels of failure.</p>

  <p>He could probably make the apps and games himself, so he must be here for the great ideas.</p>
  <h3>Viktor Wase</h3>
  <p>An actual, real scientist. Look him up! He likes to decipher dead people's stupid conversations.</p>
